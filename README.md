# SEEE3223_Project_Greenhouse
Automated Greenhouse System using STM32
This project implements a Smart Greenhouse Monitoring and Control System using an STM32F4 microcontroller. The system continuously monitors the ambient temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor and automatically controls ventilation and alarms to maintain safe environmental conditions inside the greenhouse.
